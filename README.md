# Cows and Bulls Game

The Cows and Bulls Game is a simple web-based guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated 4-digit number. The game has specific rules and limitations for the digits used in the generated number to add an extra level of challenge and fun.

## Build technologies

- **PHP** language 8.* version
- **Laravel** framework v.7 | v.8
- **MySQL** database
- **Bootstrap** (for styling)

## Game Rules

1. The player needs to guess a 4-digit number.
2. Each digit in the number should be unique (no repeating digits).
3. The generated 4-digit number has the following limitations:
- Digits 1 and 8 should be right next to each other (e.g., 18, 81).
- Digits 4 and 5 should not be on even index/position (odd-indexed positions are allowed).

## Game Play

1. When the player starts the game, a random 4-digit number meeting the rules will be generated and stored in the session.
2. The player can enter their guess for the number in a form field on the game page.
3. After submitting the guess, the game will display the number of "cows" and "bulls" in the player's guess.
- "Cows" are digits that are present in the generated number but in different positions in the player's guess.
- "Bulls" are digits that are present in the correct positions in the player's guess.
4. The player continues guessing until they correctly guess the entire number (all 4 bulls).
5. Once the player guesses the number correctly, their score is calculated based on the number of attempts made.

## High Scores

The game keeps track of the top 10 best results (high scores) and displays them in a separate high scores page.
